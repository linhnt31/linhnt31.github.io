## SFI ADVANCE CRT Research Colloquium, Apr. 2024

We had great time of Research Colloquium event organized by SFI ADVANCE CRT in Tralee, County Kerry. In the first day, we showcased our posters in the format of *presenters* and *hunters* where we can talk about research while receiving lots of advice and feedbacks from fellows. Besides, we, together, have outdoor activities including pedalo boats, climbing wall, and the tower of Hanoi quizzes in [Tralee Bay Wetlands](https://traleebaywetlands.org/). In the second day, we have two sessions on entrepreneurship. I was quite impressed by the sharing of *how to think like a entrepreneur*, the mindset of *thinking ahead and focusing on scalability rather than thinking of starting up*, and *insisting on doing hard/uncomfortable things* in the long-term road in the first session.
