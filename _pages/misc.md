## 9th Vietnam Summer School of Science

Vietnam Summer School of Science is sponsored and organised by the <a href="https://rencontresduvietnam.org/">Recontres du Vietnam Foundation</a>, <a href="https://www.icisequynhon.com/">ICISE</a> and <a href="https://viasm.edu.vn/en/home/">Vietnam Institute for Advanced Study in Mathematics</a> (VIASM). Out of 700 applicants, 150 Vietnamese students and scientists were chosen for this cohort. I am so proud to be here with warm-hearted and talented people!
