## Game Theory

---

#### 1. Definition

\- *Model the interaction among players* + *Strategic Interdependence* 

> Game theory is a mathematical method to ensure that **assumptions imply conclusions**. It analyzes what should happen given what players desire.

+ Strategy x, i.e., in this case we can call x is a kind of action, <u>***strictly dominates strategy***</u> y if it produces a higher payoff than y regardless of what all other players do.

\- Not only focus on expected utility, but depends on the preferences of players. For example, in the prisoner's dilemma problem, players can consider their friendship as a payoff, not only the jail time.

+ Payoffs in a game matrix represent a playerâ€™s preferences according to the
assumptions.

\- <u>**Deadlock**</u>: the players cannot improve the quality of their outcomes unless the opponent chooses his or her strategy incorrectly. Besides, it does not have an alternative outcome.
