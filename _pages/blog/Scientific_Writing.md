I will collect more references and reflect on my experience to update this post regularly.

> **Acknowledgement**: Key information in this post is summarised from [1]. Many thanks **Nuwan Bandara** for insightful thoughts to help a baby PhD like me improving my writing skill.

Before we start, this sentence: *'<u>I dreamt of how it would feel to invent or find something new</u>.'* stopped me for a while to think of **Why I do PhD?**

#### 1. Leave blanks

At the time of writing, if you struggle to find a suitable word for your sentence, you can leave a blank and return to it later.

#### 2. Start with the most straightforward section in your paper

Depending on your research field, you should identify which part of your work is easy to write first, e.g., experiment evaluation which you already did. It helps you build your confidence and induce you to write more difficult parts, i.e., introduction. 

#### 3. Focus on figures

Figures are representations of your research story, methods, and results. Without reading your text, readers will know: the outline of the paper, your motivation to do your work, your hypothesis, and your solution's effectiveness. 

#### 4. Write a crude introduction

'Go straight to its destination'.
