<!-- #### Research Agenda
As enhanced devices at the edge of the network exploit artificial intelligence, even novel computing challenges are raised. In my current research agenda, I investigate all aspects related to distributed intelligent systems for supporting cities and communities, with a strong focus on optimizing decentralized and self-organized infrastructures. My research finds application in several domains, among which smart city, mobility, healthcare, and cultural heritage. -->

Welcome to my personal space! This webpage is not only dedicated to my academic pursuits, but also serves as a place where I share technical posts, memorable travel experiences, and the wonderful people I’ve met along the way.

#### Short Biography
I am **Linh**. I am currently a 3rd-year PhD candidate in the fields of Federated Learning, Blockchain, and Incentivization at <a href="https://www.tcd.ie/">Trinity College Dublin, The University of Dublin</a>. My PhD is fully funded by [School of Computer Science and Statistics, Trinity College Dublin](https://www.tcd.ie/scss/) and [Research Ireland ADVANCE CRT](https://www.advance-crt.ie/). I has been fortunate to do a 3-month internship on the topics of Incentivization for Federated Unlearning from June to September, 2025 at [Delft University of Technology (TU Delft)](https://www.tudelft.nl/).

In addition to doing research, I enjoy designing, modelling, and implementing academic ideas into practical products. Here is my tech stacks:

Especially, I’m always looking to collaborate on researching Blockchain and Federated Learning.

#### News

- **[10/2025]** My joint work on Verifiable Federated Unlearning (FUL) with TU Delft is available on ![arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00833). This work recasts the FUL paradigm as verifiable FUL, grounded by the trust-by-design principle. Particularly, we presents a trust-by-design reference framework for verifiable federated unlearning, called ***veriFUL***, that upholds both the right to be forgotten and the right to verify for clients (i.e., data owners) thereby strengthening client trust and privacy control in modern AI systems.

- **[07/2025]** My work on Federated Learning and Coopetition got accepted in the flagship [IEEE Global Communications Conference 2025](https://globecom2025.ieee-globecom.org/), Taipei, Taiwan.

- **[06-09/2025]** I have started my research secondment at [TU Delft, Netherlands](https://www.tudelft.nl/), the [European Union’s Horizon Europe MSCA Staff Exchange - ENSURE-6G](https://ensure-6g.eu/) project.

- **[05/2025]** I attended 2025 [CONNECT](https://connectcentre.ie/) plenary to showcase my research, help in Trinity College Dublin, The University of Dublin, Ireland. You can find my poster [here](/assets/images/Posters/2025_Connect_Plenary.pdf).

- **[03/2025]** I got my first research paper on Critical Learning periods and Federated Learning accepted in a semi-annual flagship [2025 IEEE 101st Vehicular Technology Conference: VTC2025-Spring](https://events.vtsociety.org/vtc2025-spring/), help in Oslo, Norway.

- **[03/2025]** I got my first SoK article on Blockchain, Federated Learning, and Data Sharing accepted at a prestigious journal [ACM Computing Surveys](https://dl.acm.org/journal/csur)  [<span style="color:red">**IF: 28**</span>].
