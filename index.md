<!-- #### Research Agenda
As enhanced devices at the edge of the network exploit artificial intelligence, even novel computing challenges are raised. In my current research agenda, I investigate all aspects related to distributed intelligent systems for supporting cities and communities, with a strong focus on optimizing decentralized and self-organized infrastructures. My research finds application in several domains, among which smart city, mobility, healthcare, and cultural heritage. -->

#### Short Biography
I graduated from <a href="https://portal.ptit.edu.vn/eng/">Posts and Telecommunications Institute of Technology (PTIT)</a>, Hanoi, Vietnam with an engineer's degree from the Faculty of Electronics and Telecommunications and was a member of InNet research group of Data and Intelligent Systems Lab from 2019 to 2023 under the supervision of Assoc. Prof. Le Hai Chau and Dr. Nguyen Thi Thu Hang. 

In addition to doing research, I enjoy designing, implementing, and deploying academic ideas into practical products. Here is my tech stacks:
